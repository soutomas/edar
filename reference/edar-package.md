# edar: Convenient Functions for Exploratory Data Analysis

A collection of convenient functions to facilitate common tasks in
exploratory data analysis. Some common tasks include generating summary
tables of variables, displaying tables as a 'flextable' or a 'kable' and
visualising variables using 'ggplot2'. Labels stating the source file
with run time can be easily generated for annotation in tables and
plots.
